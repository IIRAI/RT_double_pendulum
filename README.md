# RT_double_pendulum

This project was due for a university course. This was my *first* experience coding and using Linux, so it is not properly written and organized. However I am thinking to revise it, hoping that one day this project could be an easy example of *c* programming, *real-time* programming and project *organization*.  
I will revise the project in my free time hence almost never, but hey! I'll give it a try.  

## Dependencies

The program uses the *Allegro 4* library (*TODO: link and stuff*) to install it in Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install liballegro4.4 liballegro4-dev

## Make the program

If you are understandably lazy just go in the `RL_double_pendulum` directory and use the `makefile`

    make

If you are very lazy run the program with

    make run

If you like a cleaned workspace run

    make clean

This last command remove all the object file `*.o` and the compiled program too!
